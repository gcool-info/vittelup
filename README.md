========

Project for Vittel to track dehydration and water consumption using an arduino Yun and a 1.5 water bottle. 

It uses backbone, php & mysql for the web part (check the website here: http://gcool.info/vittelup/)

The arduino yun is placed in a laser-cut box, which is attached to the bottle.
